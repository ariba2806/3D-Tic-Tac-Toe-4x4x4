# 3D-Tic-Tac-Toe-4x4x4
# Artificial Intellegence using Python

Design and implementation of a program to play three-dimensional (3D) Tic-Tac-Toe between you and the computer. 

This is an open question and part of my Algorithm Design (INFSCI 2591) class project. I came up with a powerful AI using Python, or you can also develop some simple strategies (like random moves and checksums).  It's basically a 3D version of Connect Four/Noughts and Crosses/Tic Tac Toe, but the grid can also flip itself, which means the people good at spacial awareness have a chance against people good at planning ahead.

The output will be looking like this:

You can also develop a GUI to make it look cooler. That would be a great addition to this. 

I referred to http://codereview.stackexchange.com/ in the process of designing this code. Any improvements in the code or making the AI more powerful are welcome. 

Any questions regarding the source code, idea, implementation etc. can be routed to me.
